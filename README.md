====

## Overview
The Game of Water is a game with different mini-games. It is supposed to teach the player about
the use of water and about water pollution. After winning a mini-game the player gets an information 
about waste of water or an information about the pollution of water. The last mini-game is a quiz 
where the player is supposed to show what he learned while playing the different level.


## Description

### Seagull level
The seagull level is a level where the player has to collect the random spawned trash at the beach.
The challange of the game is to collect the trash before the two seagulls collect the trash.
The player wins the game if he/she collected 15 items before the seagulls collect 10 items in total.
Therefore,  it doesn´t matter how much trash an individual seagull collects. Just the total amout of 
collected trash counts. In  case the player loses the game he/she has the change to restart the game.
Although, he/she get a notification saying "Sorry, you have lost.". In case the player wins the game he/she
gets a notification saying: "You saved the seagull´s life.".

### Dishwashing level
The second level of the game is Dishwashing level. In order to pass this level, player needs to wash all dirty dishes. Player should pick each dirty item and drag it under the tap water. After the item is washed, the game automatically puts the clean dish to the side.\  Note: Our initial idea was to add a timer or a water limitation to this level to make it more challenging, but for now it doesn’t have any limitation.
